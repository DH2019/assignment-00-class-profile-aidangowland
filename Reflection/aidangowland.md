# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists

Often times, historians have trouble turning our sometimes years'-long research into 'manageable' chunks for non-majors or the public to enjoy. While historians are generally good at telling stories, we sometimes have trouble making those stories relevant. A small website which allows a user to flip cards could serve a number of uses. First, it would be an innovative way to create an exam review as the instructor of an introductory level history course, where students often have a lot of historical figures or dates to remember, and difficulty determining what is important to remember about them. The nature of the 'flipping cards' layout would necessitate breaking the information down into its most important elements, making it easier for students to remember. Another way that this kind of layout could be used would be for a research project which deals with a large number of individuals. For instance, I currently study moral injury in the First World War. So far, I've read about one hundred FWW memoirs and it can be difficult for me to keep track of who's who, and what's important about each memoir in the context of my research. Right now, I don't have any real way of doing this that's satisfactory. Previously, I've used things like MS Access, or Workflowy, but a small website like this could be a lot easier to use and optimize.

## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 

## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?
