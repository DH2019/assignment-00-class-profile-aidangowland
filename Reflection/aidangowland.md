# Reflection

Respond to each of the questions below with a carefully thought out reflection on the assignment.

## Question 1
#### In this assignment, we used your user input to construct a small website composed of flipping cards. Can you think of a more interesting use for this basic layout? The use you describe should serve some pedagogical or research-oriented purpose for historians or humanists

A small website which allows a user to flip cards could serve a number of uses. First, it would be an innovative way to create an exam review as the instructor of an introductory level history course, where students often have a lot of historical figures or dates to remember, and difficulty determining what is important to remember about them. The nature of the 'flipping cards' layout would necessitate breaking the information down into its most important elements, making it easier for students to remember. Another way that this kind of layout could be used would be for a research project which deals with a large number of individuals. For instance, I currently study moral injury in the First World War. So far, I've read about one hundred FWW memoirs and it can be difficult for me to keep track of who's who, and what's important about each memoir in the context of my research. Right now, I don't have any real way of doing this that's satisfactory. Previously, I've used things like MS Access, or Workflowy, but a small website like this could be a lot easier to use and optimize.

## Question 2
#### This assignment asks you all to perform a certian amount of work (describing yourselves) in order to improve a project (the course roster website). What responsibilities does the "researcher" (in this case, your teacher) have to the participants (you)? What rights do or should the participants have to the end product? 
Ethics in research are important - they're what tell participants that it's okay to trust a researcher, and they tell other academics that it's okay to trust the researcher's results. In this situation, the researcher (aka the prof) has the responsibility to a) safeguard the information which is provided - anything in the .json which has been marked 'true' for private should be protected and not be made public; b) in this case participants have contributed their own intellectual property to a product, and therefore any end product should provide them with credit should the work be published. These steps would acknowledge the efforts of participants in contributing their IP, and mitigates the risk of their personal information being breached against their consent.

## Question 3
#### Information in each student record was provided as a series of "fields", that is, discrete units of information separated from each other. In the use you describe above, what fields would you need to provide for each record? Can you think of any limitations or obstacles that the use of this kind of data structure imposes on your project?
For use in my own project (FWW memoir categorization), the following fields could be used:
* Name of FWW participant
* Name of memoir/papers
* Date of publication
* Theatre of war
* Branch of service
* Nationality of participant
* Significant indications of moral injury (yes/no)
These fields provide challenges and limitations because old documents are not always as neat and tidy as programming needs them to be. Some documents are untitled, some titled documents have anonymous authors, some papers/memoirs are unpublished, others are undated, while still others are short and don't indicate a theatre of war or branch of service. All of these factors could likely be resolved, however, by determining what fields were mandatory vs. optional (like "nickname").
